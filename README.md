Analysis of spill &amp; release data from Oregon and Washington

## Data provenance
*Oregon DEQ spills data:* Dataset includes incident records from roughly 1994 to April 2018. For spills prior to 2005 in particular, many locations and (in some cases) spill volumes were not fully vetted so the data should be treated with some skepticism. The dataset includes information from the current DEQ incident management database (OpsCenter) as well as records imported from DEQ's previous spills program database, ERIS.
